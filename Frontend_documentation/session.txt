-Let's look at the main objectives

1. Highly *Functional* and minimalist design:
		especially those working on the checkout and payment processing as well as the user account

2. User freindly and interface



3. Reponsiveness



- Do more research based on the coding structures and how to code to fit the backend devs





our own sides:

The navigation menu for instance will be for all the sites.


After here each and everyone should create his or page in the github organization
For our images, we can use place holders for now.


Comment where you think it is for backends 
Let me know when you want to you need info from the backend team, I will try and get what we will need them to do as well.

There is no login or signup page for now. we can add it. Though.


I think the backend part will be most for product listing and details, checkout and payment processing.


Look into the workflow and know who you will be collaborating with  

The information provided are not enough.
Please you can edit or change it to suite the project if you think that one is easier and understandable.
We are using html, css and js

Dont worry about images, we canuse placeholders for them



ANALYSIS
Can we work in one stylesheet? the problem will be for the the navbar
What case are we using for our name classes, etc??


should we create our own team on git
