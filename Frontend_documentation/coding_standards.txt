**Coding Standards
    Code Style:
        For maintaining a consistent and clean codebase, will adhere to the following coding style guide:

    JavaScript/JSX: 
        We will follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for writing JavaScript and JSX code. 
        This style guide promotes best practices for code quality, readability, and maintainability.

    Documentation:
        Proper code documentation is crucial for understanding and maintaining the codebase. 
        We will use JSDoc-style comments for documenting code, with the following conventions:

    Code Comments: 
        We will include comments for functions, methods, classes, and 
        complex code blocks to provide clarity on their purpose, input parameters, and return values.

    File Headers: 
        Each JavaScript file should include a header comment at the top, 
        briefly describing the file's purpose, author, date, and any relevant version information.
