# ** Guidelines to creating directories

# Component Hierarchy:

    # App: The main website.

        #styles
            *homepagestyle.css
            *productlisting.css

        #images

        * homepage.html
        * Productlist.html
        * ProductDetail.html
        * shoppingCart.html
        * Checkout.html
        * User.html


# Images: All images, including the website logo and product images, are stored in the images directory.
# Fonts: Custom fonts are located in the styles directory. 

# This directory structure and component hierarchy provide a clear and organized foundation for the 
frontend development of your e-commerce website, making it easier to collaborate, maintain, and scale the project.
