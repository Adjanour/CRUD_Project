# ** Guidelines to creating directories

# Component Hierarchy:

    # App: The main application component that serves as the entry point.
        # Header: The website's header component, containing the logo, navigation, and user-related options.
        # Footer: The footer component with site information and links.
        # Routes: A container for defining various routes and their corresponding components.
            # Home: The homepage component displaying featured products and promotions.
            # ProductList: A component for listing products within categories.
            # ProductDetail: The detailed product page.
            # Cart: The shopping cart page.
            # Checkout: The checkout process, including cart summary and payment.
            # User: User-related pages for login, registration, and user profile.
        # Not Found: A 404 error page for invalid routes.


# Static Assets:

# Images: All images, including the website logo and product images, are stored in the /src/assets/images directory.
# Fonts: Custom fonts are located in the /src/assets/fonts directory.
# Static assets, such as images and fonts, 
  are organized within dedicated directories for easy access and management. 
  Component files are structured based on functionality, with common components, 
  product-related components, cart-related components, 
  and user-related components each in their respective directories. 
  The Redux store, actions, reducers, services, and utility functions are organized to manage data
   and interactions efficiently.

# This directory structure and component hierarchy provide a clear and organized foundation for the 
frontend development of your e-commerce website, making it easier to collaborate, maintain, and scale the project.
